## Features
- Copy password to the clipboard.
- Create a new entry.
- Delete an entry.
- Update the password of an entry.
- Inspect and copy non-password properties of an entry.
- [Inherits settings from your `.zshenv`.](#configuration)
- Optionally trigger `pass git push` automatically after any change.
- As opposed to regular usage of `pass`, the copied password is treated as
  transient, meaning it does not appear in Alfred's clipboard history.

## Requirements & installation
1. [➡️ Download the latest release](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-pass/releases/latest)
2. Install the requirements

    ```zsh
    brew install pass pinentry-mac
    ```

3. Setup `pass` with a GPG key. See the [pass
    website](https://www.passwordstore.org/) for further information.
4. Setup `pinentry-mac` as your `pinentry-program`:

    ```zsh
    [[ -d "$HOME/.gnupg" ]] || mkdir "$HOME/.gnupg"
    echo "pinentry-program $(brew --prefix)/bin/pinentry-mac" > $HOME/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
    gpgconf --kill gpg-agent # restart the agent
    ```

5. *Optional:* For additional security, you can disable storing the `gpg`
   password in the macOS keychain, ensuring that the password must be reentered
   every time:

    ```zsh
    defaults write org.gpgtools.common DisableKeychain -bool yes
    ```

## Configuration
This workflow reads all `PASSWORD_STORE_*` environment variables that have been
added to your `~/.zshenv`, so most configuration is done by exporting the
respective variables in `~/.zshenv`. Example: `export
PASSWORD_STORE_GENERATED_LENGTH=32`.

For information about the available environment variables, see the [pass man
page](https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/about/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a custom password-store directory, you must export your
> `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR` in your `~/.zshenv` for this workflow to work.

## Usage
- Search your passwords via the keyword `pw`.
    - <kbd>⏎</kbd>: Copy password to the clipboard.
    - <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd>: Edit entry in your Terminal, using [the Terminal
      configured in your Alfred settings](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/terminal/) and your `$EDITOR`.
    - <kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd>: Reveal `.gpg` file of the entry in Finder.
    - <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd>: Delete the entry. (⚠️ This is irreversible if
      you are not using git.)
    - <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd>: Show the full details of the entry. Select one
      of them to copy the value to your clipboard.
    - <kbd>fn</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd>: Generate a new password and overwrite this
      entry's password with it. Afterward, copy the new password. (⚠️ This
      removes the old password and is irreversible if you are not using git.)
- Use the keyword `pw new` to create a new entry. You are then prompted for a
  folder to place the new entry in. The password of the new entry is
  autogenerated based on your `pass` settings, or can be inserted from your
  clipboard.
- Use `pw gen` to generate a new password *without* creating a new entry.

## Notes on security
- All contents copied by this clipboard are marked as "transient," meaning most
  clipboard history apps will ignore them, including Alfred's clipboard history.
- This workflow is just a convenient UI for `pass`. As such, no password is ever
  stored by this workflow in any way. The workflow is completely open source.

economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
